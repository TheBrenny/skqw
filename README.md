# SKQW

Yet another audio/canvas thing. 

The aim is to be able to visualize any sound playing on your computer - a universal visualizer than can be programmed in JavaScript.

Work in progress.

##  Dev Build

Windows: make sure the node version is 64-bit for building for x64 versions of Windows, and vice-versa.

```
npm install

# on Windows
.\node_modules\.bin\electron-rebuild.cmd -m src/node_modules

npm start
```
