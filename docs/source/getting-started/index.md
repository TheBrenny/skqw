## Installation (Windows / Mac)

1. Go to the [releases page](https://github.com/michaelbromley/skqw/releases) to get the latest installer binary for your platform. On Windows, the app will be installed to `Users/<username>/AppData/Local/SKQW`, but should automatically create a shortcut on the desktop.
2. SKQW will open with the default visualization library enabled.
3. If the app does not seem to start, ensure you have at least one audio recording source enabled in your sound card settings.

#### Notes:
* The installer is not signed. This means Windows will warn you that it is not trusted and you shouldn't install it. If you trust me, you can disregard this warning ;) If there is enough interest I will consider purchasing a code-signing certificate to make such warnings go away.
* This is beta software. It is likely you will encounter bugs. Please open issues in this repo (if you know how) so I can fix them for the next release.
